# Specify the list of domains PAM authentications use NTLM authentication

#
# pam.ntlm.auth.domains: <domain1> <domain2> ...
# pam.ntlm.auth.domains: bar.com foo.bar.com foo2.bar.com
#
# The default is an empty list
#

#
# You can specify a list of AD to NTLM domain mappings with this parameter. Useful in cases
# where NTLM authentication is used because firewalls prevent Kerberos authentication, and
# prevent the automatic discovery of AD to NTLM domain mappings.

# to be syntactically correct: DOMAIN\user DOMAIN/user DOMAIN+user.
# Note that the back slash can be problemmatic for Unix shells and sometimes you

# Password hash storage.  By default, a Unix style MD5 hash of the user's

# Prevalidated users.  Disconnected authentication based on saved
# password hashes can only be used for users that have previously
# logged into the system.  If you have users that have never
# logged into the system, but still require that they be
# authenticated when the system is disconnected, you can select
# users for prevalidation.  This service is typically used for a
# group of administrators that need access to the disconnected
# system even if they have never logged in.
#
# These settings are controlled by group policy under the setting
#      "Computer Configuration"
#      -> "Centrify Settings"
#         -> "DirectControl Settings"
#            -> "Account Prevalidation"
#
# In order for a user to be prevalidated, the user must have a
# Service Principal Name (SPN) set in the form of:
#   preval/user
# Where 'user' is the User Logon Name, which can be  either 
#  1. name part in the user's UPN, if the domain part matches the user's domain.
#  2. samAccountName, if UPN is empty or UPN's domain part is different from user's domain; 
# and 'preval' is the service name specified by the
# adclient.prevalidate.service parameter below.
#
# By default, no users are prevalidated.
# If you specify either
#   adclient.prevalidate.allow.users or
#   adclient.prevalidate.allow.groups parameters,
# only those users will be prevalidated, with the exception of
# users specified in
#   adclient.prevalidate.deny.users and
#   adclient.prevalidate.deny.groups
# If you wish to include all users in the zone without any
# exceptions, set adclient.prevalidate.allow.groups to the string 'all@zone'.
#
# CAVEAT: The deny users/groups settings are useless without settings in allow
#         user/groups. In other words, a settings for deny only makes sense if there
#         is a setting for allow.
#
# For example, the attributes could be used as follows:
#   adclient.prevalidate.allow.users: jdoe
#   adclient.prevalidate.allow.groups: admins
#   adclient.prevalidate.deny.users: bsmith
#   adclient.prevalidate.deny.groups: contractors
#

# The credentials for prevalidated users are refreshed when the
# system boots, when adclient is started, after an 'adflush',
# after a user changes their password, and periodically to ensure
# that prevalidation will continue working after password changes.
# A value of 0 disables all prevalidation of users.

# This parameter allows administrators to manually specify a unique prefix for each
# trusted domain.  This prefix must be in the range of 0-511 and is used
# with the lower 22 bits of a user's or group's RID to generate a unique 31
# bit Unix UID or GID.
#  
# If domain prefixes are not manually specified, adclient will instead use
# the lower 9 bits of the last domain sub authority from the user's or group's
# SID as the domain prefix. This is not guaranteed to generate unique UIDs and
# GIDs, unless you only have one domain, but the liklihood of a collision
# is small, for a small number of trusted domains.
#
# The format of this field is:  auto.schema.domain.prefix.<domain.name>: n
